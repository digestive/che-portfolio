# Che Bajandas Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages. It includes my resume, work samples, projects, and contact information.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main landing page
- `assets/css/style.css`: Stylesheet

Work samples are formatted using markdown (.md). See `assets/documents` and `assets/tickets`. You can use GitHub Gists or draft a comment to test markdown.
